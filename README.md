## How to edit / view the files

The panel itself is a SVG file intended to be used with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org),
and it is laid out with red and black so that it is compatible with a workflow using
[K40 Whisperer](https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html)

The PCB design JSON files can be opened with EasyEDA PCB design suite, accessible at www.easyeda.com.
            
On the EasyEDA editor, select "Document" > "Open" > "EasyEDA Source" to import both JSON files into the editor.
One of them is the wiring schema, and the other one is the pcboard itself.

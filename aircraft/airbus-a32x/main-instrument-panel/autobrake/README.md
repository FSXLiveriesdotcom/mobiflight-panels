# A320 Landing Gear Status Panel

[Additional details forthcoming]

Quick notes:
The top panel mask is used to group the buttons with a black paint. Paint the area within the masked section black. Once the paint has drived, invert the mask and paint the rest of the panel Pigeon Blue (or the color of your choice for panels).

The lower panel, by-design, larger than the top. This allows the entire panel component to be inserted from back of the MIP or from the top and use the "ears" sticking out to mount to the MIP front panel itself.

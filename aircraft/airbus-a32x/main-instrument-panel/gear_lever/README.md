A32X Gear Lever

The Gear Lever is made by two layers of 2mm Acrylic (PMMA). 

1. Cut all Layers with your Laser
2. Spraypaint the Top-Panel and Bottom Panel (lay on top of each other)
3. Engrave the Top-Panel - to simplify alignment, put an sheet of paper on your Laserbed and "Cut" the Top-Panel with minimum Power. So you get a thin line on the Paper, use the Outline for aligning.
4. When the Color is dried, plug all Parts together. Maybe use some Glue to fix Parts together.
5. For the Lever-Mechanism you need 6 pcs. M3x50 and 4 pcs. M1x10 (M1 for Switches)
6. Solder wires to the Switches to cennect them to the Arduino.

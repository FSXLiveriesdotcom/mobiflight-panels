This is an alternate version of the [Landing Gear Lever](https://github.com/MobiFlight/mobiflight-panels/tree/main/aircraft/airbus-a32x/main-instrument-panel/gear_lever) with the following differences:
 * The included laser cutouts use 3mm Acrylic stock
 * Small alterations to the down arrow
 * Additional LED mounts behind the arrow to facilitate different color LEDs, if desired
 * A provision to make your own lever out of three layers of acrylic with the addition of a knurled knob that is often used for camera mounts (shown below)
 * A Fusion 360 file is included, in the event you would like to modify the design. (Note the current Fusion 360 design has an additional "lip" on the backmost layer that facilitates the mounting of this panel in your MIP)

# A320 Landing Gear Status Panel

[Additional details forthcoming]

Quick notes:
The top panel mask is used to group the buttons with a black paint. Paint the non-masked section the main color (Pigeon Blue) then, once dried, invert the mask and paint the area around the grouped buttons in black.

The PCB is, by-design, larger than the panel itself. This allows the entire panel component to be inserted from back of the MIP and allow the holes in the PCB to be used as mounts.

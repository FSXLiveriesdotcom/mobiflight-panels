# Button caps design for resin printers
This folder contains ready to print STL files for resin printers. Buttons caps are compatible with 3+3+3mm panel layout made from acrylic. Fusion 360 source files will be added later.

Panel source file: https://github.com/MobiFlight/mobiflight-panels/blob/main/aircraft/airbus-a32x/pedestal/mcdu/A320_MCDU-laser.svg

**Please note** that even though I tried my best to make the design as good as possible, it may not be perfect because I am not a professional 3D designer myself. Moreover, your panels may differ even if they are from the same source data because of variables that I have no control over, such as the  your laser configuration or the thickness of the paint you apply to the buttons or the panel itself.

# What you need:
* Resin 3D printer (I am using Creality Halot One)
* White resin (I am using Anycubic Basic White resin)

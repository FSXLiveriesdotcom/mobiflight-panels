**Please note** that even though I tried my best to make the design as good as possible, it may not be perfect because I am not a professional 3D designer myself. Moreover, your panels may differ even if they are from the same source data because of variables that I have no control over, such as the  your laser configuration or the thickness of the paint you apply to the buttons or the panel itself.

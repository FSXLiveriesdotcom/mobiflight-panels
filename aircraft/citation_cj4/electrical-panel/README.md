Citation CJ4 electrical power

This panel contains the main power switch and other related controls for the 
Working Title Cessna Citation CJ4.

Some things are not fully implemented in the simulator, like Generator resets,
and Emergency lights "Armed" vs "ON" mode. Also, the standalone artificial 
horizon "test" mode is just done by using the momentary switch to turn it on,
so it turns off when the switch is released.

This is a very simple panel cutout template for a generic 8 button panel that 
uses the "KD2" switches from Aliexpress. It was cut from 3mm acrylic, sanded to break the glossy
surface (so paint sticks better) and spray painted gray. There are two M3 screws to fix the 
top and bottom together.

The links to aliexpress listings rarely work for a long time, but if you search for 
"KD2 momentary pushbutton" you should find current listings. There are different colors 
for leds and the button mechanics, the ones in the photo above are from white switches 
that are spray painted matt black and then text is engraved with a laser. The result
is not 100% clean and pretty, when I tested, but I think it might be possible to improve
it a bit if you tune your speed and laser power settings for the engraving.

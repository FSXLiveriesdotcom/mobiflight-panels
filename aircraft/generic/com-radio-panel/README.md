# Generic Airliner-style radio panel

This design can have one to three buttons on the front panel, like this example has COM1 and COM2 selectors, 
and a BOTH button so that it can work a bit as an audio panel too, in case you don't have a separate audio
panel. Or you can leave them out if you want to build separate COM1, COM2, NAV1, NAV2 radios, just don't solder 
the buttons and leds, and remove the cutouts from the panels.

The included configuration file makes it work as a combined COM1+2 radio for MSFS2020, but naturally this
can be changed with MobiFlight if you wish.

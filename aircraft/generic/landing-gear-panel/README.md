# Generic flight simulation panels

This is a simple landing gear panel that has "Korry" switches and a slot for a gear handle mechanism. This is still work in progress, but the panel files are provided as an example and inspiration.

## The mechanism

Included is a 3d STL file that can be printed without supports. Print **two, but mirrored** so they can be placed the flat side
against each other, using 10mm M3 nylon standoffs. Assemble with M3 screws. There are also STL files for a very simple gear handle and wheel shaped knob.

I used 2mm carbon fiber rod for the pins, and locked the tiny "mouse button micro switch" in place with two wooden toothpicks that happened
to have a good friction fit.

Note that the mechanism photo above does not yet feature a cutout for the circuit board, thats why it looks different.

## Finished panel

The buttons have a 3D-printed "cap" over a tactile pushbutton and two 3mm leds that light up the top and bottom sides based on data from the simulated aircraft landing gear position and battery switch state.

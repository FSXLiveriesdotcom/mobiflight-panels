# Streamdeck panel

_## NOTE: This design needs work
_
_The front panel of StreamDeck v1 is held in place
by double sided tape, and if you hang it by the front panel like this,
the tape will give in over time (yeah, wonder why I know? :-)) So this needs
some kind of bracket that keeps it from falling down when the buttons are 
pressed._

This panel fits the Elgato StreamDeck 5x3 button version, which just drops in.
It stays in place by gravity and the properly sized hole, so naturally the panel
needs to be mounted flat on a pedestal or similar, or you need to somehow fix it
in place in case you want to mount it upright or even on an overhead panel. This
design simply assumes that gravity keeps the StreamDeck in place. Use M3 screws
and for example short standoffs or M3 nuts to lock the pieces together.

Alternatively you could cut the panel without the screw holes and glue the pieces
together before painting I guess.

# Streamdeck panel

This panel fits the Elgato StreamDeck 5x3 button version, which just drops in.
It stays in place by gravity and the properly sized hole, so naturally the panel
needs to be mounted flat on a pedestal or similar, or you need to somehow fix it
in place in case you want to mount it upright or even on an overhead panel. This
design simply assumes that gravity keeps the StreamDeck in place. Use M3 screws
and for example short standoffs or M3 nuts to lock the pieces together.

Alternatively you could cut the panel without the screw holes and glue the pieces
together before painting I guess.

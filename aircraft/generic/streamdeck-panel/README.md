# Streamdeck panel

This panel fits the Elgato StreamDeck 5x3 button version, which just drops in.
It stays in place by gravity and the properly sized hole, so naturally the panel
needs to be mounted flat on a pedestal or similar, or you need to somehow fix it
in place in case you want to mount it upright or even on an overhead panel. This
design simply assumes that gravity keeps the StreamDeck in place.

## Update: Support pieces

The design now includes 3D-printable support pieces for the StreamDeeck. It turns out the
Streamdeck base falls down over time if you support it from the front faceplate only, 
as it is fixed in place with adhesive tape.
